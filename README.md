## About Me

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience building production applications. I'm the founder and CEO of **SimplicityFunds**, where I'm developing Simplicity — a budgeting app that takes an "intention-first" approach to personal finance rather than reactive expense tracking.

I also founded **CodeWithAli**, a web and desktop application development company where I've built enterprise-grade SaaS platforms serving 50+ concurrent users with real-time features.

I build things that matter. Every line of code I write is in service of solving real problems for real people.

## What I'm Building

**Simplicity** — A financial management platform that helps people budget proactively instead of reactively tracking expenses after the fact. Features include:
- Plaid integration supporting 11,000+ financial institutions
- Stripe payment processing
- AI-powered financial insights
- Financial calendar system
- Cross-platform (Web + Desktop via Tauri)

**CodeWithAli Enterprise Platform** — A comprehensive business management SaaS featuring:
- Real-time team chat
- Employee scheduling system
- Invoicing & billing
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant architecture

## Core Competencies

**Full-Stack Architecture** — Designing and building complete applications from database schema to polished UI, with a focus on scalable, maintainable code.

**Fintech Integration** — Deep experience with Plaid (bank connections), Stripe (payments), and building financial data pipelines that handle sensitive user information securely.

**State Management** — Building complex, synchronized application state across React/Zustand architectures with real-time data updates.

**Desktop Applications** — Cross-platform desktop development using Tauri, bringing web technologies to native performance.

**User Research & Product** — Conducted 1,000+ survey responses and 40+ user interviews to validate product decisions and understand user behavior.

## Philosophy

I don't just write code — I build products. Every technical decision I make is grounded in solving a real problem for real users. I've learned that the best software comes from deeply understanding the people who will use it.

8 years of self-taught development has taught me that the most important skill isn't any particular framework — it's the ability to learn, adapt, and ship.
